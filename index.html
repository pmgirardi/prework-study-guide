        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE is a declaration. This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. </li>
          <li>The title element defines the title of the webpage.</li>
          <li>The html is the opening tag which represents the root, or start, of our HTML document.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>
          <li>The lang="en" is an attribute that tells the browser the language (in this case, en for English).</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, descriptions, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The h1 - h6 are heading sizes that are child elements of the body element.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li child elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <li>The img child element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The br child element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The a child element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>

          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>The checkout command is to move the working branch to a new branch.</li>
          <li>The -b flag creates a new branch.</li>
          <li>The feature/starter-code is the name of the new branch. The feature/starter-code is the name of the new branch. The feature/starter-code is the name of the new branch. We have added the prefix, feature, to indicate that it is a feature. It is good practice to name the branches for the feature that will be developed by them to help indicate the purpose of each branch.</li>
          <li>git add -A: add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area. The -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes. The staging area informs Git that the changes will be added in the next commit.</li>
          <li> git commit -m "add starter code": commits changes. We use the -m flag to associate a message with our commit</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: we identify a Git command with the git keyword. Then use the pull command to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment. The origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. The main keyword indicates the branch. In our case, we are receiving a branch called main from the GitHub repository.</li>
          <li>git push origin feature/starter-code: we are using a new command push to push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch. </li>
